Quil examples
=============

Examples of Quil sketches.

Check `src/quil_sketches` folder and it's subfolders. Each `.clj` file is a separate sketch. Some of them shows particular Quil feature and some of them are simply beatiful animations. You can start with running them one by one and studying their sources.

### How to run examples

Clone repo with examples to you machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/quil/quil-examples.git
```

##### Using lein REPL

Start REPL:
```shell
lein repl
```
Require selected sketch to run it:
```clojure
user=> (require 'quil-sketches.gen-art.01-cross-with-circle :reload)
```
Note: 
* you should prefix sketch namespace with single quote: `'quil-sketches.gen-art.01-cross-with-circle` 
* `:reload` option is needed if you want to run it several times. Otherwise sketch won't run on second and subsequent `require` calls.


##### Using `lein run`

Use following command to run selected sketch:
```shell
lein run -m quil-sketches.gen-art.01-cross-with-circle
```
When you close sketch JVM won't exit, so you need to do it manually e.g. using `Ctrl+C` combination. 

##### Using LightTable

Start LightTable.  
Open folder containing the project: 
```
File -> Open folder
```
Open file containing sketch and evaluate it using following keys combination:
```
Ctrl+Shift+Enter
```

##### Using emacs

Open file with sketch:
```shell
emacs src/quil_sketches/gen_art/01_cross_with_circle.clj
```
Start cider:
```
M-x cider-jack-in
```
Evaluate opened file:
```
C-c C-k
```
Sketch will open. 
You can run other sketches by opening their files and evaluate their contents via `C-c C-k`

### How to create your own sketch

It is simple. You can either modify existing sketch or create new one. To create new sketch first you need to create sketch file e.g. `src/quil_sketches/my_super_sketch.clj` and use some existing sketch as initial template (don't forget to modify namespace to `quil-sketches.my-super-sketch`).

Happy hacking!
